# In this exercise we will use data from the Supernova Cosmology project, one of the two teams which first found that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating in 1999. A simple introduction to the methods and findings of the SCP group can be found at https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2009/10/27/evolving-dark-energy/. The original paper is Perlmutter *et al.* 1999, "Measurement of $\Omega$ and $\Lambda$ from 42 High Redshift Supernovae", The Astrophysical Journal, Vol. 517, page 565.
# 
# The data set we will be using is a more recent sample, containing observations of 580 supernovae, known as the Union 2.1 sample from the paper Suzuki *et al*. 2012, "THE *HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE* CLUSTER SUPERNOVA SURVEY. V. IMPROVING THE DARK-ENERGY CONSTRAINTS ABOVE $z>1$ AND BUILDING AN EARLY-TYPE-HOSTED SUPERNOVA SAMPLE", The Astrophysical Journal, vol. 746, page 85.
# 
# The data are in the file SNeData.txt.

# Take a look at the file using the `with` statement. 
# 
# One should always close files when finished using them.
# The `with` statement makes this automatic; using it is a good habit to form.
# 
# Lets simply open the file and print out the first 10 lines to see how the file is formatted:



with open('SNeData.txt', 'r') as infile:
    for i in range(10):
        line = infile.readline()
        line = line.rstrip("\n")
        print(line)


# The top of any good data file intended for sharing with others contains a "header" -- some lines at the top which describe the contents of the file.
# 
# Here we see that the file contains the SCP Union2.1 data, and that the columns are:
# 
#  * the name of the supernova
#  * the redshift measured from its spectrum
#  * its distance modulus
#  * an estimate of the measurement error in the distance modulus
#  * the probability the supernova occurred in a low-mass host galaxy
#  
# For this exercise, we won't care what a supernova's name is, and we won't get to the last column until the end of the exercise.

# # Part A

# The difference between the absolute magnitude $M$ and the apparent magnitude $m$, a number called the *distance modulus* which depends only upon the distance to the source
# 
# $$
# \begin{split}
# m-M &= - 2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{1}{F_0}\frac{L}{4\pi d^2}\right) + 2.5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{F_0}\frac{L}{4\pi(10\ \textrm{pc})^2}\right)  \\
# &= 5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{d}{10\ \textrm{pc}}\right)
# \end{split}
# $$
# Because $M$ and $m$ are logarithmic functions, their difference is proportional to the *ratio* of the distance $d$ to 10 pc.
# 
# This is the distance measurement given in the data file for the distance to the supernovae. The measured LUMINOSITY distance is then
# 
# $$ d_L = 10^{(m-M)/5 +1} \textrm{pc} $$
